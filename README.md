# Question: How do you convert a number to an Excel-style column name and vice versa? C# Summary

The C# console application is designed to convert a number to an Excel-style column name and vice versa. It first prompts the user to input a number. This number is then passed to the `NumberToColumnName` method, which uses a stack to store the characters representing the column name. The method uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) and uses the remainder to determine the corresponding letter (A-Z). The letters are pushed onto the stack until the number is reduced to zero. The stack is then converted to an array and returned as a string, representing the Excel-style column name. The application then prompts the user to input an Excel-style column name. This string is passed to the `ColumnNameToNumber` method, which iterates over each character in the string. For each character, the method multiplies the current number by 26 and adds the ASCII value of the character minus the ASCII value of 'A' plus one. This effectively converts the column name back into a number. The number is then outputted to the console.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version. Both versions use the ASCII values of uppercase English letters to perform the conversions. However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions.

1. User Input: In the C# version, the user is asked to enter a number or an Excel-style column name directly. In the Python version, a menu is provided to the user to choose between converting a number to an Excel-style column name, converting an Excel-style column name to a number, or exiting the application.

2. String Concatenation: In the C# version, a Stack is used to store the characters of the column name, which are then converted to an array and used to create a new string. In the Python version, string concatenation is used directly to build the column name.

3. Division and Modulo Operations: In the C# version, the division and modulo operations are performed separately. In the Python version, the divmod function is used to perform both operations at once.

4. Character to Number Conversion: In the C# version, the ASCII value of 'A' is subtracted from the ASCII value of the column name character to get the corresponding number. In the Python version, 64 is subtracted from the ASCII value of the column name character, which is equivalent to subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' minus 1.

5. Main Function: In the C# version, the main function is the entry point of the application and is called automatically when the application starts. In the Python version, the main function is defined but needs to be called explicitly. This is done in the if __name__ == "__main__": block, which ensures that the main function is called only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way, using the same logic and approach. They both use a console application to interact with the user, asking for a number to convert to an Excel-style column name and vice versa.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Input/Output: In C#, the Console class is used for input and output, while in Java, the Scanner class is used for input and the System.out.println method is used for output.

2. String Manipulation: In the C# version, a Stack<char> is used to build the column name in reverse order, and then it is converted to a string using the ToArray method. In the Java version, a StringBuilder is used to build the column name, and characters are inserted at the beginning of the string using the insert method.

3. Character Manipulation: In both versions, characters are manipulated by adding or subtracting the ASCII value of 'A'. However, in C#, this is done using the char data type, while in Java, this is done using the charAt method of the String class.

4. Method Naming: The method names are different in the two versions. In C#, the methods are named NumberToColumnName and ColumnNameToNumber, while in Java, the methods are named convertToTitle and titleToNumber. This is more of a stylistic difference rather than a functional one.
